# Boom Todo
A simple todo list project with a powerful code base.

## About 

BoomTodo is a SPA written on top of Sapper and Svelte for the frontend client and
implements a REST API served with express and written in TypeScript.

This app is part of a challenge of my mentor in Platzi Master Program. I had to build a todo list but with scalable and powerfull backend code base and only in one week. This is the result!

- You can see the demo deployed in a Compute Engine instance [**-- here --**](http://34.69.218.129/)

- And a the static api docs: [**-- here --**](http://34.69.218.129/api-docs)
